<p>A random story.  </p>
<p>In one of the trips I went home, I was cleaning my parents' house and noticed a framed painting of plum blossom tree left laying flat on a nightstand.  It is a gift from my eldest nephew for my dad's birthday.  The drawing was quite well painted, and I felt it's such a shame to let it lay flat.  So, I decided to hang it up.  I spent a couple moments admiring it after I did that, cause I was quite impressed by my nephew's painting.<br>
A couple days later, my brother, the painter nephew's dad, came visit.  He too noticed the painting was hung up.  He asked "who hung the painting".  I proudly and promptly said "I did.".  "I couldn't stand letting it lay flat on a nightstand," I added.  </p>
<p>He then said, "You've hung the picture upside down."  Then he spent 15 min conversation on how to tell the correct orientation of the painting by looking at the twigs in the painting.  </p>
<p>I was totally embarrassed, but was grateful that my brother corrected my mistake.  It also reminded me how oblivious I am about the little (good) things that I take for granted.  I have completely forgotten that a plant, or a tree, big or small, their twigs and branches always grow up, even sometimes extending sideways.  </p>
<p>As I was hanging the painting up, I was thinking "Luckily my nephew did see his painting just left laying around, it would have broken his heart."  Now, I wonder, would he be more upset to see the painting laying around or to see the painting was hung upside down.</p>

<h2>Hypothesis Test and Alpha Levels</h2>
<p>A Hypothesis test is used to test a claim that someone has about an observation may be different from the known population parameter.  </p>
<p><strong>Alpha level</strong> (<strong>\( \alpha \)</strong>) of a hypothesis test helps us determine the critical region of a distribution.  Refer to <a href="course-notes/inferential-statistics/lesson-9/#critical-region">Critical Regions</a> below.</p>
<p><strong>Null Hypothesis</strong> is always an equality.  It is the claim we are trying to provide evidence <em>against</em>.  We commonly write the null hypothesis as one of the following:
\[  H_{0} : \mu_{0} = \mu\\  H_{0} : \mu_{0} \ge \mu\\  H_{0} : \mu_{0} \le \mu \]</p>
<p><strong>Null Hypothesis</strong> is result we are checking against the claim.  This is always some kind of inequality.  We commonly write the alternative hypothesis as one of the following:
\[  case\;a &gt;&gt; H_{0} : \mu_{0} \neq \mu\\  case\;b &gt;&gt; H_{0} : \mu_{0} \gt \mu\\  case\;c &gt;&gt; H_{0} : \mu_{0} \lt \mu \]</p>
<p>If we know which direction we are checking against the claim, use case b or case c, else we typically use case a.  Case a is a two tailed test, while case b and case c are one tailed tests.  Read more on this <a href="course-notes/inferential-statistics/lesson-9/#one-tailed-two-tailed">below</a>.  </p>
<h2>
<a id="critical-region" name="critical-region"></a>Critical Regions</h2>
<p>When it comes to constructing a hypothesis test, it is best to choose a significant level before the test is performed.  The results of the test can be reported as significant a certain critical level, but it is important that you are not "fishing" for results before seeing the results in your sample.  For additional readings on Hypothesis Testing, here is an <a href="http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics/understanding-hypothesis-tests:-significance-levels-alpha-and-p-values-in-statistics" title="Hypothesis Testing">article</a>.  </p>
<p>The corresponding Z-critical values, \( Z_{critical} \) at each \( \alpha \) level for one-tailed test and two-tailed test respectively:
\[
\begin{array}{c|cc}
\alpha &amp; \text{one-tailed} &amp; \text{two-tailed} \\
\hline
0.05 &amp; 1.67 \; or\; -1.67 &amp; \pm 1.96 \\
0.01 &amp; 2.32 \; or\; -2.32 &amp; \pm 2.57 \\
0.001 &amp; 3.08 \; or\; -3.08 &amp; \pm 3.27
\end{array}
\]</p>
<p>If we get a sample mean in the critical region, then we decide that most likely those sample means by chance.  The \( Z_{critical} \) values are the same that we used to calculate confidence intervals.  </p>
<p>When we do statistical test, we'll set our own criteria for making a decision (in other words, we'll choose an alpha level). Then we decide if the probability of obtaining that sample mean is less than the alpha level (ie. sample means fall in the critical region, and \(Z\) is greater than \(Z_{critical}\)). Then if there is an evidence of an effect (of the intervention).</p>
<p>Note that we <strong>CANNOT prove</strong> if a hypothesis is true.  We can only obtain evidence to reject the null hypothesis.  </p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:
A null hypothesis says "Most (more than 50%) dogs have four legs." and the alternative hypothesis says "Most dogs have less than four legs."</p>
<p>In a sample of 10 dogs, there are 6 dogs with less than four legs.  </p>
<p>In this case we are taking 50% as significance level.  We are able to reject the null hypothesis based on this.  Under a typical statistical test (such as using a 5% significance level), this sample data would be evidence against null hypothesis, but not necessarily enough evidence/information to reject the null hypothesis.  </p>
<p>However, if the definition of null hypothesis was changed to indicate 70% of dogs have four legs, then our current evidence would be enough to reject the null hypothesis to reject the null hypothesis at a 5% significance level.  </p>
<h2>
<a id="one-tailed-two-tailed" name="one-tailed-two-tailed"></a> One Tailed and Two Tailed</h2>
<p>Take a hypothesis test:
\[
    H_{0}:
    \begin{cases}
      \mu = \mu_{I},  &amp; \mu_{I} \text{is post intervention}
    \end{cases} \\
    H_{A}:
    \begin{cases}
      \mu \lt \mu_{I},  &amp; \text{right one-tailed, with } \mu_{I} \text{ greater than } \mu \\
      \mu \gt \mu_{I},  &amp; \text{left one-tailed, with } \mu_{I} \text{ less than } \mu \\
      \mu \neq \mu_{I},  &amp; \text{right one-tailed, with } \mu_{I} \text{ greater or less than } \mu
    \end{cases}
\]</p>
<p>We choose a one-tailed, or directional hypothesis test when we predict a direction of the treatment effect.  Alternatively, when we do not predict the direction of the treatment, we choose the two-tailed or non-directional test.  In general we use two-tailed because it is more conservative.  We are less likely to reject the null when it is true.  It also prevents us from mistaking the wrong direction of the effect.  </p>
<h2>Decision Errors</h2>
<p>There are two types of Hypothesis Decision Errors:
<strong>Type I error</strong>: is when you reject the null when the null hypothesis is actually true.<br><strong>Type II error</strong>: is when you fail to reject the null when the null hypothesis is actually false.  </p>

<h3>The Search for Animal Shelters to Volunteer</h3>
<p>In the Buddhist Dharma class last night, we talked about relationships we have with everything in the world - family we are born in, friends and acquaintances we encounter, animals, trees, and even things we own.  One thing came up in the lesson was how rarely we spent time just to be with ourselves nowadays.  So much so that we can't live without all the distractions - social media website, the TV, the movies, the radio, the cellphones, the excessive indulgence in food...  Anything that we could use to fill the void.</p>
<p>One of the take aways from last night, was we should be more aware of our motivations of our actions and/or daily habits.  I realized my movie / tv show binge-watching isn't great.  I need to be more careful of how I spend my time, and whom I spend time with.  While the practice meditation is great, I figured my restless self is not at the level to do that all day.  I personally feel more practical to do something more productive, something that connects me better to the outside world, or humanity.  I used to volunteer at soup kitchen, and I miss it now.  </p>
<p>Given that I always have patience and love for animals, I took the time to research for a list of animal shelters in Singapore.  Here is the list:</p>
