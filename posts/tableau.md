Since Udacity changed the Data Visualization course module in the DAND program (they have chosen to partner with Tableau), I was given the options to finish my last project (the data visualization project) either with D3 (old syllabus) or with Tableau (new syllabus).  

Thinking that Tableau was just a software, and given the fact I hadn't had great experience with Javascript programming even back in my frontend days, I decided to switch to the new module and give Tableau a try.  

However I soon learn that it is quite a terrible mistake.  First off, the new Visualization with Tableau tutorial was awful.  It barely covers the essence of visualization designs.  The parts that it is supposed to demonstrate Tableau features, it is not even half as good or thorough as the tutorials on Tableau website itself.  It is rather apparent that Udacity launched this switch without having the course fully ready.  

Even with the tutorials on Tableau website, Tableau desktop hasn't proven itself to be the best software.  There are lots of non self-explanatory error messages such as "Your connection has probably timed out.  Try to reconnect to Tableau Server.  "  or "Internal Error - An unexpected error has occurred and the operations could not be completed.  ".  It took a fair bit of puddling around, trial and errors, and observations, that I finally figured out what those messages mean, and how to work around it by logging out of the previous session, and re-logging back in to create a new session.  Note that this is really merely a workaround.  It is NOT a real solution as it wastes so much time to log out and log in while you work on a project.

Another disappointment was that all the students on Data Analyst Nanodegree programme who agreed to the switch found out that we are not given the student license of Tableau, but those license was available for those who are on Frontend developer project.  Without the license, we are only allowed certain size of datasets.  The limit was somewhat around 15,000,000.  This is truly frustrating as I had all the ideas in mind on how to analysis the data and what kind of storyboard I wanted to create, only to find out later I can't tell the story I want.  

This makes me feel highly dissatisfied with Udacity at the last couple months of my program.  I feel this is a very dishonest conduct of business, by launching something that's so far from ready.  Because of the lack of structural support and guidance for the last course, and license limitation with Tableau, I was at least delayed a month from graduation.  For someone who is paying the course with her own out-of-pocket money, this is just absurd.  Now will I be able to get refund for last month's subscription fees?  I doubt it ......
