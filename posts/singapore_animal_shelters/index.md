## The Search for Animal Shelters to Volunteer ##

In the Buddhist Dharma class last night, we talked about relationships we have with everything in the world - family we are born in, friends and acquaintances we encounter, animals, trees, and even things we own.  One thing came up in the lesson was how rarely we spent time just to be with ourselves nowadays.  So much so that we can't live without all the distractions - social media website, the TV, the movies, the radio, the cellphones, the excessive indulgence in food...  Anything that we could use to fill the void.

One of the take aways from last night, was we should be more aware of our motivations of our actions and/or daily habits.  I realized my movie / tv show binge-watching isn't great.  I need to be more careful of how I spend my time, and whom I spend time with.  While the practice meditation is great, I figured my restless self is not at the level to do that all day.  I personally feel more practical to do something more productive, something that connects me better to the outside world, or humanity.  I used to volunteer at soup kitchen, and I miss it now.  

Given that I always have patience and love for animals, I took the time to research for a list of animal shelters in Singapore.  Here is the list:
