#Data Analysis Process

1. **Question**    
    Problem begins with a question you want answer or problem you wanna solve.  For example:    
    - Characters of students who pass projects
    - How can I stock stores with products that most people want to buy?
2. **Wrangler**    
    - Data Acquisition   
    - Data Cleaning   
3. **Explore**   
    - Building intuition
    - Finding patterns
4. **Draw Conclusions**     
    This requires statistics and machine learning (that is beyond the scope of this course)
    - Draw Conclusion => Users less likely to XXX
    - Make Prediction => Predict what products a user would like
5. **Communicate**  
    - Blog post, paper, email, powerpoint, in-person conversation

The steps aren't always sequential.  We might go back and forth between data wrangling and exploration.  Along the process, one may go back to the question to further refine the question.  And data acquisition might occur before the question arises.


# Data Wrangling
Data Types:   
Usually data acquired are in JSON or CSV (comma separated value) format.
