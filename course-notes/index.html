<p>Instead of working on this project on a google sheet files, I decided to write my own python script to simulate the experiments.  </p>
<p>1) Histogram generated shown as below.   <br><img alt="Original Cards" src="../images/descriptive-statistics/original52.png"><br>
Histogram for original card values are negatively skewed (towards right).    </p>
<p>2) Randomly Drawing 3 Cards   <br>
I wrote python scripts with pandas and matplotlib for the rest of the project.  </p>
<p>3) Distribution of Sum of 3 Randomly Drawn Cards   <br><strong>30 Samples of Sum of 3 Randomly Drawn Cards</strong>   <br><img alt="30 Samples of Sum of 3 Randomly Drawn Cards" src="../images/descriptive-statistics/sample30.png"></p>
<p>Statistical Description of this sample with n = 30:  <br>
count  30.000000  <br>
mean   19.866667  <br>
std     5.550603  <br>
min     9.000000  <br>
25%    15.000000  <br>
50%    20.000000  <br>
75%    24.000000  <br>
max    30.000000    </p>
<p><strong>500 Samples of Sum of 3 Randomly Drawn Cards</strong>      <br><img alt="500 Samples of Sum of 3 Randomly Drawn Cards" src="../images/descriptive-statistics/sample500.png"></p>
<p>Statistical Description of this sample with n = 500:  <br>
count  500.000000  <br>
mean    19.542000  <br>
std      5.337529  <br>
min      5.000000  <br>
25%     16.000000  <br>

75%     24.000000  <br>
max     30.000000    </p>
<p>4) As sample size increases, the curve gets more normalized (bell-shaped).     </p>
<p>5) Q:  Within what range will you expect approximately 90% of your draw values to fall? What is the approximate probability that you will get a draw value of at least 20? Make sure you justify how you obtained your values.    </p>
<p>To determine the range where 90% of the values fall, I found the closest corresponding z-value to be 1.28.   Therefore, with the following formula, I determined the range for our sample with 30 draws, and sample with 500 draws.   </p>
<p>\[<br>
  z = \frac{ x - \mu }{\sigma} \\
  x_{30, 90%} = 26.971442   \\
  x_{500, 90%} = 26.374   \\
\]  </p>
<p>To draw at least 20 from each of the samples, the corresponding z values are:    </p>
<p>\[
  z_{30, &gt;20} = \frac{20 - 19.866667}{5.550603} = 0.024021
  \\
  z_{500, &gt;20} = \frac{20 - 19.542000}{5.337529} = 0.085807 \\
\]</p>
<p>For sample with sample size 30, at z = 0.024021, the probability is 0.51 (51%).  That means the change of drawing 3 cards with sum greater than 20 from this sample is 49%.      </p>
<p>For sample with sample size 500, at z = 0.024021, the probability is 0.534 (53.4%).  That means the change of drawing 3 cards with sum greater than 20 from this sample is 46.6%.    </p>
<p>Finally, here's a <a href="http://www.stat.ufl.edu/~athienit/Tables/Ztable.pdf">link to the z-table</a> for reference.  </p>

<h3>Types of Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Ordinal Data</strong> - ranks with no fixed intervals nor zeros   </li>
<li>
<strong>Interval Data</strong> - ranks with equal intervals     </li>
<li>
<strong>Ratio Data</strong> - ranks with equal intervals and an absolute zero   </li>
<li>
<strong>Nominal/Categorical Data</strong> - data with no numerical values (typically yes/no, in/out, successful/unsuccessful)    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Types of Tests</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Parametric</strong> - hypothesis testing that make assumptions about the parameters of the populations, \( \mu \) and \( \sigma \).</li>
<li>
<strong>Non-Parametric</strong> - hypothesis testing that do not require population parameters</li>
</ul>
<h3>Characteristics of Non-Parametric Testings</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is no way to calculate a mean or standard deviation      </li>
<li>The data is based on frequencies or proportions    </li>
<li>The data is nominal (successful vs unsuccessful, 1 or 0, yes or no, mountain vs beach etc.)    </li>
<li>The data are not based on Normal distribution    </li>
</ul>
<h3>\( \chi^2 \) Goodness of Fit Test</h3>
<p>How well our observed frequencies 'fit' our expected frequencies? <br>
\[
  \chi ^2 = \sum{ \frac{(f_0 - f_e)^2}{f_e} }
\]
\( \chi^2 \) is smaller when the observed value is closer to the expected value.   <br>
\( \chi^2 \) is NEVER negative and therefore \( \chi^2 \) statistic is one-directional.     </p>
<p>For each category, we have one \( \chi^2 \) statistics.  When we have more categories, \( \chi^2 \) statistics get bigger with the number of categories.    </p>
<h3>Degrees of Freedom</h3>
<p>For n x m, 2 dimensional nominal data:
\[
  df = (N_n - 1) * (N_m - 1) \\
  \text{where } N_n \text{ and }N_m \text{ are number of columns, and number of rows respectively. }
\]</p>
<h3>Cramer's V \( (\phi_c) \)</h3>
<p>\[
  \phi_c = \sqrt{\frac{\chi^2}{n(k-1)}}  \\
  k \text{ is the smaller number between number of rows or number of columns}\\
  n \text{ is the total sample size regardless of treatments}
\]</p>
<h3>Assumptions and Restrictions for \(\chi^2\) Tests</h3>
<ul>
<li>Avoid dependent observations.  Independence will be violated if any participants were given two treatments instead of one.     </li>
<li>Avoid small expected frequencies, therefore in general have a larger number of participants.   Sample size should be at least 20, and each expected cell frequencies should be at least 5.    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Linear Regressions</h3>
<p>Line of best fit forms a line to help us:  <br>
- describe data  <br>
- make predictions     </p>
<p><strong>Observed Y vs Expected Y</strong>   <br><strong>Expected Y</strong> \( \hat{y} \) are the ones calculated/predicted based on the best fit regression line.  <br><strong>Observed Y</strong> \( y \) are collected data or real-life data.  <br><strong>Residual</strong> is the difference between Observed value and Expected value.  </p>
<p>A few ways to find the line of best fit:  <br>
- Find a line to minimize the sum of residuals.   The problem with this approach is sometimes, negative and positive residuals cancel each other out.     <br>
- Find a line that minimize the sum of <strong>absolute</strong> residuals.  <br>
- Find a line that minimize the sum of squared residuals, \( \sum{(y - \hat{y})} \)</p>
<p>When we use calculus to determine the slope, b:<br>
\[
  b = \frac{\sum{(y_i - \bar{y})(x_i - \bar{x})}}{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}} \\
  = r (\frac{S_y}{S_x}) \\
  \text{where } r \text{ is Pearson's Correlation Coefficient and }\\
   S \text{ are standard deviations of } x \text{ and } y.
\]</p>
<p>We have decided to symbolize the regression line by y = bx + a, where b represents the slope and a represents the y-intercept.
Since \( b = r(\frac{S_y}{S_x}) \), we can also symbolize the regression line like this:  <br>
\[ y = r(\frac{S_y}{S_x})x + a \]</p>
<p><strong>Pearson's Correlation Coefficient \( r \)</strong>  <br>
A high \(r\) value indicates a strong correlation. This could contribute to high \(r^2 \) value, which indicates the percentage of differences in Y is due to differences in X.  </p>
<p><strong>Standard Error of Estimates</strong>  <br>
Standard error of estimates: <br>
\[
SE = \sqrt{ \frac{\sum (y - \hat{y})^2}{N-2}}
\]</p>
<p><strong>Factors that Affect the Regressions</strong> <br>
- outliers affect the value of r, correlation Coefficient
- outliers also affect the linear regression line

<p><strong>Relationships</strong>   <br>
How one variable is related to the other?</p>
<p><strong>Variable X and Y</strong>    <br>
X is often referred to as the predictor, explanatory, independent variable.      </p>
<p>Y is often referred as the outcome, response, dependent variable.  </p>
<p>Scatterplot is a popular/ most common way to show relationship of X and Y variables.      </p>
<p><strong>Strong Relationships</strong>    <br>
Strong relationships usually have less scattered plots.  If we draw an eclipse surrounding the data points, the smaller the ratio of minor axis to the major axis, the stronger the relationship is.  </p>
<p><strong>Direction of Relationships</strong>       <br>
Positively related - Y responses in the same direction as X changes; Negatively related - Y responses in opposite directions of X changes.</p>
<p><strong>Correlation Coefficient, (r)</strong>    <br>
Also known as Pierson's r.  </p>
<p>r is a fraction, with the covariance of x and y (how much do they vary together) as the numerator, and the product of standard deviation of x  and standard deviation of y as the denominator.<br>
\[
  r = \frac{cov(x,y)}{ S_x * S_y } = \frac{cov_{x,y}}{ S_x * S_y }
\]  <br>
r measures the strength of a relationship, by measuring how closely the data falls along a straight line.      </p>
<p>Even though r is a ratio, it is not interpreted as a percentage.  However, \(r^2\) is a percentage of the variation in y explained by variation in x.  \(r^2\) is called the coefficient determination.       </p>
<p><strong>True Correlation of Population, rho, \( \rho \)</strong>     <br>
We usually perform hypothesis testing with t-tests.
\[
  H_{0} : \rho = 0 \\
  H_{1} : \rho \gt 0 \\
  H_{1} : \rho \lt 0 \\
  H_{1} : \rho \ne 0
\]</p>
<p><strong>Causation vs Correlations</strong>    <br><strong>Causation</strong> - One variable caused another to happen.     </p>
<p><strong>Correlation</strong> - There is a relationship between two variables.  But there are lots of lurking variables.  For example, there are two variables X and Y.  They could have a relationship because both of them are influenced by variable A, or Y is influenced by X <strong>through</strong> variable A.  In this case, variable A is called the mediating variable.  </p>
<p>To make a causal statement: <br>
     - the independent variable would have to occur BEFORE the dependent variable.<br>
     - have to rule out other lurking variables too</p>
<p><strong>Fallacies</strong>  <br>
Ambiguous Temporal Precedence - we don't know which variable happens first.   <br>
Third variable problem    <br>
Post-hoc fallacy      </p>
<p><strong>t value and Correlation Coefficient, (r)</strong>   <br>
t value and r:
\[
  t = \frac{r  \sqrt{N-2}}{\sqrt{1-r^2}}
\]

<p>One of the popular Multiple Comparison Tests is Tukey's Honestly Significant Differences.    <br><strong>Tukey's Honestly Significant Differences (HSD)</strong>  <br>
Tukey's HSD is calculated as the following:
\[
\text{Tukey's HSD} = q * \sqrt{\frac{MS_{within}}{n}} \\
q \text{ is looked up with } df_{within} \text{ and } k \text{, the number of treatments/sample groups}   \\
n \text{ is the number of samples in one sample group}
\]   </p>
<p>If the mean difference between/among treatments are greater than Tukey's HSD, the difference is significant.    </p>
<p>Note this is very similar to Z test and T test. For Z tests, the margin of error is:
\[
\text{Margin of Error} = z * \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
\]</p>
<p>Whereas for t tests, the margin of error is:
\[
\text{Margin of Error} = t * \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
\]</p>
<p><strong>Cohen's D for Multiple Comparisons</strong>  <br>
For normal comparisons, Cohen's D is calculated by
\[
\text{Cohen's D, } d = \frac{\bar{X_1} - \bar{X_2}}{SD_{pooled}}
\]   </p>
<p>In multiple comparisons, Cohen's D is calculated by
\[
\text{Cohen's D, } d = \frac{\bar{X_1} - \bar{X_2}}{\sqrt{MS_{within}}}
\]</p>
<p>Cohen's D is calculated per pair comparisons.  </p>
<p><strong>\( \mathbf{\eta ^ 2} \)</strong>  <br>
\( \eta ^2 \) is defined as the proportion of total variance that is due to between-group differences (explained variation).  </p>
<p>\[
\eta ^2 = \frac{SS_{between}}{SS_{total}} \\
      = \frac{SS_{between}}{SS_{between} + SS_{within}}
\]    </p>
<p><strong>Reporting Reports of Anova</strong>  <br>
We report the results of F Statistics as the following:   <br>
\[
   F(df_{between}, df_{within}) = 27 \quad p &lt; 0.05 \quad \eta ^2 = 0.90 \quad \\
   \text{p is estimated, by hand} \\

- test with a <strong>strong</strong> dosage    </p>
<p><strong>ANOVA Assumptions &amp; Conclusions</strong>   <br>
We assume:  <br>
- <strong>Normality</strong>: the population of which our samples are from are all normally distributed.  <br>
- <strong>Homogeneity of Variance</strong>: the samples come from populations that have equal amount of variability.   <br>
- <strong>Independence of Observations</strong>: The results found from one samples won't affect the others.   </p>
<p>We could have the following exceptions:  <br>
- violate the normality if the sample is large  <br>
- violate the homogeneity of variance if:  <br>
        - almost equal sample sizes  <br>
        - ratio of any two variances doesn't exceed 4     <br>

<h2>Data Analysis Process</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Question</strong>  <br>
    Problem begins with a question you want answer or problem you wanna solve.  For example:    <ul>
<li>Characters of students who pass projects</li>
<li>How can I stock stores with products that most people want to buy?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Wrangler</strong>    <ul>
<li>Data Acquisition   </li>
<li>Data Cleaning   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Explore</strong>   <ul>
<li>Building intuition</li>
<li>Finding patterns</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Draw Conclusions</strong>   <br>
    This requires statistics and machine learning (that is beyond the scope of this course)<ul>
<li>Draw Conclusion =&gt; Users less likely to XXX</li>
<li>Make Prediction =&gt; Predict what products a user would like</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Communicate</strong>  <ul>
<li>Blog post, paper, email, powerpoint, in-person conversation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The steps aren't always sequential.  We might go back and forth between data wrangling and exploration.  Along the process, one may go back to the question to further refine the question.  And data acquisition might occur before the question arises.</p>
<h2>Data Wrangling</h2>
<p>Data Types: <br>
Usually data acquired are in JSON or CSV (comma separated value) format.    </p>

<p>In lesson 11, we learned to perform t-tests for two independent samples.  However, in real statistical studies, there are a lot of times we need to compare more than two independent samples.  When we have \( n \) independent samples, the number of t-tests we need to perform are:
<!-- {n+1 \choose 2k} == \binom{n+1}{2k} -->
\[
  \text{no of t-tests with n samples} = \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!}
\]</p>
<p>However, the same concept of t-test applies here.  Remember t is defined by a function of the distance apart from each other and the variability of each sample.
\[
  t_{statistic} = \frac{ \bar{X_1} - \bar{X_2}}{ \sqrt{ \frac{ S_p^2 }{ n_1 } + \frac{ S_p^2 }{ n_2 }}}
\]
When we compare 3 or more samples, we compare distance/variability between means (as numerator) and some kind of sample error (as the denominator)</p>
<p><strong>Think about this:</strong> <br>
Q: How can we compare three or more samples? <br>
A: Find the average squared deviation of each sample means.</p>
<p>Q: Will the <strong>Grand Mean</strong>, mean of the sample means be the same as the mean of all values in each sample? <br>
A: Sometimes.  Only when the sample sizes are equal for each sample, that the Grand Mean will be the same.</p>
<p><strong>Between Group Variability</strong> <br>
Between group variability is the variability between/among samples.   <br>
Q: What conclusions can we draw from the deviation of each sample mean from the mean of the means? <br>
A: The smaller the distance between sample means, the less likely the population means will defer significantly.  Vice versa the greater the distance between sample means, the more likely population means will differ significantly.  </p>
<p><strong>Within Group Variability</strong> <br>
Within group variability is the variability of the individual samples within a sample.  <br>
The greater the variability of each individual sample, the less likely population means will differ significantly.  (thinner, non overlapping normal distribution.) <br>
The smaller the variability of each individual sample, the more likely population means will differ significantly.  (wider, overlapping normal distribution)</p>
<p>Since we are analyzing the variabilities between samples and within samples, we call this Analysis of Variability (ANOVA).  We have one way ANOVA when we have one independent variable (sometimes called a factor)  </p>
<p><strong>F Statistics</strong> <br>
F statistics is the ratio of between group variability (numerator) to the within group variability (denominator)
If the between group variability is big, it constitutes to big F statistics, which results in rejecting the null hypothesis and accepting the alternative hypothesis.<br>
Whereas if the within group variability is large, it makes the F statistics small, which results in accepting the null hypothesis and rejecting the alternative hypothesis.</p>
<p>\[
F = \frac{ \text{between group variability}}{ \text{within group variability}} \\<br>
  = \frac{ \sum_{j=0}^k n_j (\bar{x_j} - \bar{x_G})^2 / (k-1)}{\sum_{i=0}^N  (x_i - \bar{x_k})^2 / (N-k) } \\
  n_j \text{ is sample size for each sample}   \\
  = \frac{ n \sum_{j=0}^k (\bar{x_j} - \bar{x_G})^2 / (k-1)}{\sum_{i=0}^N (x_i - \bar{x_k})^2 / (N-k) } \text{when sample size is same for all samples}  \\
  k \text{ is number of sample groups}      \\
  N \text{ is total number of all samples of each sample group}     \\
\]</p>
<p>F can also be formulated as
\[
F = \frac{SS_{between} / df_{between}}{SS_{within} / df_{within}} \text{ where } SS \text{ stands for Sum of Squares }      \\
  = \frac{MS_{between}}{MS_{within}} \text{ where } MS \text{ stands for Mean Square }
\]</p>
<p>Note that \(df_{between}\) is \( k - 1 \) while \(df_{within}\) is \( N - k \)</p>
<p>If we add \(df_{between}\) and \(df_{within}\) up, we get \( N - 1\) which is the total degree of freedom \(df_{total}\)
\[
df_{total} = df_{between} + df_{within} \\
= N - 1
\]</p>
<p>Similarly, the total variation \(SS_{total}\) is the sum of \(SS_{between}\) and \(SS_{within}\).<br>
\[
SS_{total} = SS_{between} + SS_{within} \\
= \sum{(x_i - \bar{x_G}) ^ 2}
\]</p>

<li>Less cost-effective</li>
<li>More time-consuming</li>

</ul>
<h2>Two-Sample Tests</h2>
<p>Considering two independent normally distributed samples collected, when we subtract those two data, we get a new dataset.<br>
\[
    N ( \mu_{1}, \sigma_{1} ) - N ( \mu_{2}, \sigma_{2} ) = N ( \mu_{1} - \mu_{2}, \sqrt{ \sigma_{1}^2 + \sigma_{2}^2 } )
\]</p>
<p>The standard deviation, \( SD \) would be:
\[
    SD = \sqrt{ SD_{1}^2 + SD_{2}^ 2 }
\]</p>
<p>The standard error, \( SE \) would be:
\[
    SE = \sqrt{ \frac{SD_{1}^2}{n_{1}} + \frac{SD_{2}^2}{n_2}}
\]</p>
<p>The t statistic, \( t_{statistic} \) would be:
\[
    t_{statistic} = \frac{ (\bar{x_{1}} - \bar{x_{2}} ) - (\mu_{1} - \mu_{2})}{ SE }
\]</p>
<p>The degree of freedom, \( df \) would be:
\[
    df = (n_{1} - 1) + (n_{2} - 1) = n_{1} + n_{2} - 2
\]
or the smaller value between
\(
(n_{1} - 1) \text{ and } (n_{2} - 1)
\).</p>
<h2>Pooled Variance</h2>
<p>Pooled variance is a method for estimating variance
given several different samples taken in different circumstances where the mean may vary
between samples but the true variance is assumed to remain the same. The pooled variance is
computed by using
The Pooled Variance, \( S_{p}^2 \) would be:
\[
    S_{p}^2 = \frac{(SS_{x} + SS_{y})}{df_{x} + df_{y}}
\]
where \( SS_{x} = \sum (x_{i} - \bar{x})^ 2 \)
and \( SS_{y} = \sum (y_{i} - \bar{y})^ 2 \)</p>
<p>The Standard Error, \( SE_{(\bar{x}-\bar{y})} \), using Pooled Variance is:</p>
<p>\[
    SE_{(\bar{x}-\bar{y})} = \sqrt{ \frac{S_{p}^2}{n_x} + \frac{S_{p}^2}{n_y} }
\]</p>
<p>The full t statistic \( t_{statistic} \) formula would be:
\[
    t_{statistic} = \frac{ (\bar{x} - \bar{y}) - \delta }{ SE_{(\bar{x}-\bar{y})} }
\]
\(\bar{x} - \bar{y} \) is called the observed difference.
The \( \delta \)expected_diff is derived from the Null Hypothesis, \( H_0 \), when
\[
    H_0: \mu_x - \mu_y = \delta
\]
There are lots of cases where \( \delta \) was assumed 0.  </p>
<p>When we use Pooled Variance, we hold the following assumptions:
1. X and Y should be two random samples from two independent populations. <br>
2. Populations that X and Y come from, should be approximately normal.  This is less important when sample size is really large ( &gt;30).<br>
3. Sample data can be used to estimate population variances.
4. Population variances should be roughly equal.</p>

<h2>T-Test</h2>
<p>Z-test works when we know the population parameters such as \( \mu \) and \( \sigma \).  For any samples drawn from this population, the samples would form a sampling distribution that is a normal distribution, with:
\[
    mean = \mu  \quad\text{where M is mean of sample means}\\
    SD = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \quad\text{where n is sample size}
\]
\( SD \) is also known as Standard Error \( SE \) which is used for Z score calculation.</p>
<p>For any sample mean, \( M \), we can determine where it falls on this sampling distribution by standardizing, aka, finding the z-score \( Z \), given its formula below:
\[
    Z = \frac{M - \mu}{ SE }
\]</p>
<p>However, much of the times, with sample data, we don't know population \( \mu \) and population standard deviation \( \sigma \). We only have samples which we must use to draw all our conclusions.  </p>
<p>When working with samples, we usually estimate the population standard deviation using the sample standard deviation with Bassel's correction.<br>
\[
  S =  \sqrt{ \frac{ \sum_1^n{ (x_{i} - \bar{x}) ^ 2 }} { n-1 } } \\
  where S is estimated population standard deviation, n is sample size
\]</p>
<p>Without population parameters and with only sample data, we end up with a new distribution that is more prone to error, called the t-distribution. The t-distribution is more spread out and thicker in the tails.  </p>
<p>Same principals applies to t-distribution.  When n increases:</p>
<ul>
<li>the t-distribution approaches a normal distribution</li>
<li>the t-distribution gets skinner tails</li>
<li>S, the estimated population standard deviation, gets closer to the real population standard deviation \( \mu \).  </li>
</ul>
<p>With t-distribution and t-test, we can determine:</p>
<ol>
<li>How different a sample mean is from a population mean</li>
<li>How different two sample means are from each other.  These two samples can be either:<ul>
<li>dependent</li>
<li>independent</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Degrees of Freedom</h2>
<p>t-distribution are defined by degrees of freedom, \(df\), which generally is \( n - 1 \) for single dimension data.  The \(df\) for 2D or 3D sample is \[df = (n-1)^d\;\text{where power d is the number of dimension}\]
Degrees of freedom are the number of pieces of information that can be freely varied, without violating any given restrictions.  It is pieces of independent information to estimate another piece of information. As the degrees of freedom increases, it better approximates the normal distribution.
\( n - 1 \) is also known as the effective sample size.  As shown above, it is used to estimate the population standard deviation with Basel's correction.  </p>
<h2>Hypothesis Testing with t-statistics</h2>
<p>Like the z-test, if the t-statistic falls far from the mean, where t-statistic is 0, we reject the null. To do so, we compare the sample mean to population mean, by calculating t-statistic.</p>
<p>For one sample t-test, the t-statistic is:
\[
    t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_{0}}{S/\sqrt{n}} \text{where:}\\
    \bar{x}\text{ is sample mean}\\
    \mu_{0}\text{ is population mean}\\
    S \text{ is standard error, aka. standard deviation of sample}\\
    n \text{ is the sample size}
\]
The sample mean, \(\bar{x}\) is also the point estimate for the population mean.
t-statistics increases when:</p>
<ul>
<li>a larger difference between \(\bar{x}\) and \(\mu_{0}\)</li>
<li>larger \( n \)</li>
</ul>
<p>For hypothesis testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>larger</strong> the value of \(\bar{x}\), the stronger the evidence that \(\mu \gt \mu_{0}\).</li>
<li>The <strong>smaller</strong> the value of \(\bar{x}\), the stronger the evidence that \(\mu \lt \mu_{0}\).</li>
<li>The further the value of \(\bar{x}\) from \(\mu_{0}\) in either direction, the stronger the evidence that \(\mu \neq \mu_{0}\).</li>
</ul>
<p>We reject the null hypothesis if the t-statistic is less than or greater than the t-critical value, at a given \( \alpha \) level.</p>
<h2>P-Value</h2>
<p>For one-tailed test, the P-value is the probability above the t-statistic if it is positive, and below the t-statistic if it is negative.  For two tailed test, the p-value will be the sum of probability on both ends.  We reject the null hypothesis when the p-value is less than the \( \alpha \) level.</p>
<p>After calculating the t-statistic, we go to <a href="http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/pValue1/" title="P-Value with t and DF">GraphPad</a> to get the exact P-value. There are also other calculators on <a href="http://www.graphpad.com/" title="GraphPad Calculators">GraphPad</a> that are worth checking out.  </p>
<h2>Cohen's d</h2>
<p>Cohen's d is another common measure of effect size, when comparing means, named after Jacobs Cohen.  It is a <strong>standardized mean difference</strong> that measures the distance between 2 means in standard deviation units.
\[
    Cohen's d = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_{0}}{S} \\
    where\;\bar{x}\text{ is sample mean, }\mu_{0}\text{ is population mean, and }S\text{ is sample standard deviation}
\]</p>
<h2>Confidence Interval</h2>
<p>Confidence interval is the interval where the population mean will probably lie.<br>
At a given confidence level, or alpha level, we first determine the t-critical value.<br>
Confidence interval for a two-tailed test is:
\[
  \begin{align}
    CI &amp; = M \pm t_{critical, \alpha} \cdot SE_{sample} \\
    &amp; = M \pm t_{critical, \alpha} \cdot \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}
  \end{align}
\]</p>
<h2>Margin of Error</h2>
<p>Margin of Error is one-half width of the confidence interval.  CI's upper bound is sample mean, \(M + t_{critical} \cdot \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}} \) plus margin of error; whereas CI's lower bound is sample mean, \( M - t_{critical} \cdot \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}} \).  Therefore:
\[
  Margin\;of\;Error = t_{critical} \cdot \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}
\]</p>
<h2>Dependent t-tests</h2>
<p>Dependent samples are generated when the same subject takes the test twice.  This is a within subject design.  Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>when same subject is applied two conditions</li>
<li>subject is given a pre-test and post-test</li>
<li>longitudinal study (development over time)</li>
</ul>
<p>The within-subject designs generate paired data.  Then we look at the difference between these two sets of data, \( D_{i} \)</p>
<h2>Types of Designs</h2>
<ol>
<li>Repeated measures design (eg errors on two types of keyboards)
\[ H_{0}: \mu_{1} = \mu_{2} \]</li>
<li>Longitudinal design
\[ H_{0}: \mu_{time1} = \mu_{time2} \]</li>
<li>Pre-test vs Post-test
\[ H_{0}: \mu_{pre} = \mu_{post} \]</li>
</ol>
<h2>Effect Size</h2>
<p>In experimental studies, Effect Size refers to the size of a treatment effect.  In non-experimental studies, Effect Size may refer to the strength of the relationships between the variables.  </p>
<p>In the Z-test or one sample t-test, the mean difference is \( \bar{x} - \mu \).  Mean differences is great when we variables with easy to understand meanings.</p>
<h3>Types of Effect Size Measures</h3>
<p>There are many Effect Size measures, but they all fall into two main groups:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Difference Measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mean difference</li>
<li>standardized difference<ul>
<li>Cohen's d (in SD units)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correlation Measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>\( r^2 \): the proportion (or %) of variation of one variable that is related to ("explained by") another variable.<br>
    \[ r^2 = \frac{ t^2 }{ t^2 + df } \\
        where\; t \text{ is t statistics, not } t_{critical} \text{ and } df \text{ is degree of freedom}
    \]</li>
<li>\( r^2 \) is also known as the coefficient of determination.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Statistical Significance</h2>
<p>Statistical Significant means:
- we reject the null
- results are not likely due to chance (sampling error)</p>
<h2>Meaningfulness of Results</h2>
<ul>
<li>What was being measured?  Do/Does the variable(s) has any practical, social, theoretical importance?</li>
<li>Effect Size: Small effect size doesn't necessarily mean the results have lower importance, and vice versa, large effect size doesn't necessarily means the results have greater importance.  </li>
<li>Can we rule out random chance/sampling errors?</li>
<li>Can we rule out alternative explainations? (lurking variables)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hypothesis Test and Alpha Levels</h2>
<p>A Hypothesis test is used to test a claim that someone has about an observation may be different from the known population parameter.  </p>
<p><strong>Alpha level</strong> (<strong>\( \alpha \)</strong>) of a hypothesis test helps us determine the critical region of a distribution.  Refer to <a href="inferential-statistics/lesson-9/#critical-region">Critical Regions</a> below.</p>
<p><strong>Null Hypothesis</strong> is always an equality.  It is the claim we are trying to provide evidence <em>against</em>.  We commonly write the null hypothesis as one of the following:
\[  H_{0} : \mu_{0} = \mu\\  H_{0} : \mu_{0} \ge \mu\\  H_{0} : \mu_{0} \le \mu \]</p>
<p><strong>Null Hypothesis</strong> is result we are checking against the claim.  This is always some kind of inequality.  We commonly write the alternative hypothesis as one of the following:
\[  case\;a &gt;&gt; H_{0} : \mu_{0} \neq \mu\\  case\;b &gt;&gt; H_{0} : \mu_{0} \gt \mu\\  case\;c &gt;&gt; H_{0} : \mu_{0} \lt \mu \]</p>
<p>If we know which direction we are checking against the claim, use case b or case c, else we typically use case a.  Case a is a two tailed test, while case b and case c are one tailed tests.  Read more on this <a href="inferential-statistics/lesson-9/#one-tailed-two-tailed">below</a>.  </p>
<h2>
<a id="critical-region" name="critical-region"></a>Critical Regions</h2>
<p>When it comes to constructing a hypothesis test, it is best to choose a significant level before the test is performed.  The results of the test can be reported as significant a certain critical level, but it is important that you are not "fishing" for results before seeing the results in your sample.  For additional readings on Hypothesis Testing, here is an <a href="http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics/understanding-hypothesis-tests:-significance-levels-alpha-and-p-values-in-statistics" title="Hypothesis Testing">article</a>.  </p>
<p>The corresponding Z-critical values, \( Z_{critical} \) at each \( \alpha \) level for one-tailed test and two-tailed test respectively:
\[
\begin{array}{c|cc}
\alpha &amp; \text{one-tailed} &amp; \text{two-tailed} \\
\hline
0.05 &amp; 1.67 \; or\; -1.67 &amp; \pm 1.96 \\
0.01 &amp; 2.32 \; or\; -2.32 &amp; \pm 2.57 \\
0.001 &amp; 3.08 \; or\; -3.08 &amp; \pm 3.27
\end{array}
\]</p>
<p>If we get a sample mean in the critical region, then we decide that most likely those sample means by chance.  The \( Z_{critical} \) values are the same that we used to calculate confidence intervals.  </p>
<p>When we do statistical test, we'll set our own criteria for making a decision (in other words, we'll choose an alpha level). Then we decide if the probability of obtaining that sample mean is less than the alpha level (ie. sample means fall in the critical region, and \(Z\) is greater than \(Z_{critical}\)). Then if there is an evidence of an effect (of the intervention).</p>
<p>Note that we <strong>CANNOT prove</strong> if a hypothesis is true.  We can only obtain evidence to reject the null hypothesis.  </p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:
A null hypothesis says "Most (more than 50%) dogs have four legs." and the alternative hypothesis says "Most dogs have less than four legs."</p>
<p>In a sample of 10 dogs, there are 6 dogs with less than four legs.  </p>
<p>In this case we are taking 50% as significance level.  We are able to reject the null hypothesis based on this.  Under a typical statistical test (such as using a 5% significance level), this sample data would be evidence against null hypothesis, but not necessarily enough evidence/information to reject the null hypothesis.  </p>
<p>However, if the definition of null hypothesis was changed to indicate 70% of dogs have four legs, then our current evidence would be enough to reject the null hypothesis to reject the null hypothesis at a 5% significance level.  </p>
<h2>
<a id="one-tailed-two-tailed" name="one-tailed-two-tailed"></a> One Tailed and Two Tailed</h2>
<p>Take a hypothesis test:
\[
    H_{0}:
    \begin{cases}
      \mu = \mu_{I},  &amp; \mu_{I} \text{is post intervention}
    \end{cases} \\
    H_{A}:
    \begin{cases}
      \mu \lt \mu_{I},  &amp; \text{right one-tailed, with } \mu_{I} \text{ greater than } \mu \\
      \mu \gt \mu_{I},  &amp; \text{left one-tailed, with } \mu_{I} \text{ less than } \mu \\
      \mu \neq \mu_{I},  &amp; \text{right one-tailed, with } \mu_{I} \text{ greater or less than } \mu
    \end{cases}
\]</p>
<p>We choose a one-tailed, or directional hypothesis test when we predict a direction of the treatment effect.  Alternatively, when we do not predict the direction of the treatment, we choose the two-tailed or non-directional test.  In general we use two-tailed because it is more conservative.  We are less likely to reject the null when it is true.  It also prevents us from mistaking the wrong direction of the effect.  </p>
<h2>Decision Errors</h2>
<p>There are two types of Hypothesis Decision Errors:
<strong>Type I error</strong>: is when you reject the null when the null hypothesis is actually true.<br><strong>Type II error</strong>: is when you fail to reject the null when the null hypothesis is actually false.  </p>
