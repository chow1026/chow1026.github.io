## Lesson 7: Central Limit Theorem ##

The Central Limit Theorem is used to help us understand the following facts regardless of
whether the population distribution is normal or not:

1. the mean of the sample means is the same as the population mean
2. the standard deviation of the sample means is always equal to the standard error (i.e.
\\[ SE = \frac{\sigma}{ \sqrt{n}} \\]
3. the distribution of sample means will become increasingly more normal as the sample size,
n, increases.
