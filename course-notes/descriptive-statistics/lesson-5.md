## Lesson 5: Standardizing ##

1. If we are concerned about a proportion less than or greater than a certain value on a distribution, we should use RELATIVE FREQUENCIES.
2. When a bin-size is too big, we can't tell for sure the detailed values of the bin; when a bin-size is too small, the distribution becomes more and more of a uniform distribution.  A predicament: We want a small bin size to have as much details as possible about the location of data values, relative to the rest of the distribution.  
3. We solve this conundrum with a theoretical model of our distribution.
4. Z score: how many standard deviation any number, x, is away from the mean.  We can convert any value from a normal distribution to a z score.  When we do this we standardize the distribution.  
    - \\[ z = \frac{ x - \mu }{\sigma} \\]
5. A negative z score means:
    - The original value, \\( x \\) is less than the mean, \\( \mu \\).
    - The original value, \\( x \\) minus the mean, \\( \mu \\) is negative.
6. On a standardized distribution, the mean, \\( \mu \\) is 0.  
7. On a standardized distribution, the standard deviation, \\( \sigma \\) is 1.
