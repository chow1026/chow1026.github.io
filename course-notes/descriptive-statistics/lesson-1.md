## Lesson 1: Introduction to Research Methods ##
### Some Definitions ###

1. **Constructs**
    - **Contruct**: Anything that is difficult to measure because it can be defined and measured in very many different ways.
    - **Operational Definition**: Operational Definitions {of a construct} is a unit of measurement for a construct.  Once an Operational Definitions is defined {for a construct}, it is no longer a construct.
    - **Extraneous Factors**: Also known as "Lurking Variables", these factors that could impact the outcome of an experiment or test.  Extraneous factors should be held constant as much as possible to maximize accuracy of experiments/tests.


2. **Samples and Populations**
    - **Population Parameter**: denoted by \\(  \mu \\) (Î¼ pronounced mu) are values that describe the whole population.
    - **Sample statistics**: denoted by \\( \overline{x} \\) (pronounced as X-bar) are values that describe our sample.  Statistics are used to estimate/approximate the population parameter.
    - **Sampling Error**: The difference of values between true population parameter and sample statistics.
    - **Sample Size**: The size of the group that we choose to represent population.  The bigger the sample size, the smaller the sampling error generally.

3. **Golden Arches Theory {of Conflict Prevention} by Thomas Friedman**
    - Correlations doesn't mean causation: Just because two variables are relatable, it doesn't mean once causes the other to occur.  

4. **Experiments vs Observational Studies**
    - To show relationships => Perform observational studies i.e. surveys.
        + (+) Easy way to get information of a population,
        + (+) Relatively inexpensive
        + (+) Can be conducted remotely
        + (+) Anyone could access and analyze survey results
        + (-) Untruthful responses
        + (-) Biased responses
        + (-) Respondents not understanding the questions (Response Bias)
        + (-) Respondents refuse to answer (Non-response Bias)
    - To show causation => Perform controlled experiments i.e.

5. **Other Definitions**
    - **Treatments**: The manner in which researchers handle subjects.
    - **Observational Studies**: When an experimenter watches a group of subjects and does not introduce a treatment.
    - **Independent Variables**: The variable that the experimenter chooses to manipulate, usually plotted along x-axis on a graph.
    - **Dependent Variables**: The variable that the experimenter chooses to measure, usually plotted along y-axis on a graph.
    - **Treatment Group**: The group of a study that receives a varying levels of independent variable, used to measure the effect of a treatment.
    - **Control Group**: The group of study that doesn't receive treatment, used as a baseline when compared to treatment groups.
    - **Placebo**: Something that is given to the control group so they think they are getting the treatment, when in reality it causes no effect on them.
    - **Blinding**: A technique used to reduce bias, i.e. placebo is blinding.
    - **Double Blinding**: A technique to ensure those who administer treatments and those receiving treatments do not know who is actually receiving which treatment.  
    - **Controlled Factors**: Factors
    - **Random Assignments**: A technique used to minimize impact of the other uncontrolled factors to the results of an experiment. Randomization works best with larger groups.
    - **Within-Subject Design**: A technique to see how a factor influences the impact we are measuring, for the same study subject, keeping other controlled and uncontrolled factors constant.
