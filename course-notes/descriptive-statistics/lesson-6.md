## Lesson 6: Normal Distribution ##

1. Probability Distribution Function (PDF): PDF is a normal curve with an area of 1 beneath it, to represent the cumulative frequency of values.
2. Probability: We could use the PDF to find the probability of a specific measurement occurring.  Using the specific value of the measuremnet, \\( x \\), we calculate the  \\( z \\) value.  
    - \\[ z = \frac{ x - \mu }{\sigma} \\]
3. Referring to the z-table, we can get the probability of a measurement of equal or less than \\( x \\) occurring.  
4. On any normal distribution, standardized or not, approximately 68% of population falls within \\(\pm 1{\sigma} )\\ of the population mean \\(\mu)\\.
5. On any normal distribution, standardized or not, approximately 95% of population falls within \\(\pm 2{\sigma} )\\ of the population mean \\(\mu)\\.
