## Lesson 7: Central Limit Theorem ##

The Central Limit Theorem allows us to know where any sample mean falls on a distribution of sample means.  The Central Limit Theorem is used to help us understand the following facts regardless of
whether the population distribution is normal or not:

1. The mean of the sample means is the same as the population mean, i.e.
\\[ M = \mu} \\] where M is mean of sample means, \\(\mu\\) is mean of population
2. The Standard Error, which is the standard deviation of the Sample Means (also known as Sampling Distribution) is estimated by the following formula:
\\[ SE = \frac{\sigma}{ \sqrt{n}} \\]
3. The distribution of sample means will become increasingly more normal as the sample size, n,  increases.
4. Sampling Distribution often form a normal distribution.
