## Lesson 3: Central Tendency ##
### Some Definitions ###

1. **Mode**:
    - Mode is always on x-axis
    - Mode can be used to describe any type of data we have, be it numerical or categorical
    - All scores in a data set affects the mode.
    - Even if we take a lot of samples from the same population, the mode will NOT be the same in each sample.
    - There is NO equation for mode.
2. **Mean**:
    - All scores in a distribution affects a mean
    - The mean can be describe with a formula.  As notated below:
        - \\[ \mu  = \frac{ \sum{x} }{N} \\]
        - \\[ \bar{x} = \frac{ \sum_{i=0}^{n}{x} }{n}\\]
    - Many samples from the same population will have similar means.
    - The means of a sample can be used to make inferences of a population it came from.
    - The mean will change if we add an extreme value to the data set.  
3. **Median**:
    - Median is the middle of the data.
    - When there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle scores, after arranged in ascending/descending order.  
    - Median is generally Robust - Strong and Steady, Doesn't affected much by the outlier data.  
    - Median serves as a better measurement for the center of the data when the data distribution is heavily skewed.  
    - If dataset has EVEN number, n, of data,
        - \\[  \frac{X_{\frac{n}{2}} + X_{\frac{n}{2} + 1}}{2} \\]
    - If dataset has ODD number, n, of data,
        - \\[ X_{\frac{n}{2} + 1} \\]
4. **Conclusions of Measures of Center**:
    - Mean, Mode and Median are measure of center for datasets.
    - Mean has a simple equation.
    - Mean will always change if any data value changes.
    - While Mode IS affected by bin size, both Mean and Median are NOT affected by bin size.
    - While Mean IS severely affected by outliers, Median and Mode are NOT severely affected by outliers.
    - Mode is easy to find on histogram.
