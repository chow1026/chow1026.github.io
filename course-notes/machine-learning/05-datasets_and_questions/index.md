## Accuracy and Training Set Size     

The larger the training data set the higher to chance of obtaining higher accuracy.  If the training set isn't big enough, accuracy could be low.  However, the accuracy increment by dataset size would plateau off at some point, as adding more data points won't improve accuracy much.  

In real life, there might be cases where datasets are small in size, and it is not possible to attain more data.  But most data projects, it is always good to start with question like this : how does accuracy change with the number of training events especially if we have the power to go out and obtain more data (data points).  

Datasets with incomplete information will also lead to low accuracy.
