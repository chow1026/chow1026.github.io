## The Zen of Python ##
### by Tim Peters ###
:: Type `import this` in python CLI

- **Beautiful is better than ugly.**
- **Explicit is better than implicit.**
- **Simple is better than complex.**
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- **Readability counts.**
- **Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.**
- Although practicality beats purity.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- Unless explicitly silenced.
- **In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.**
- There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it.  
- Although that way may not be obvious unless you are Dutch.  
- **Now is better than never.**  
- Although never is often better than *right* now
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.  
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Namespaces are one honking good idea - let's do more of those!
