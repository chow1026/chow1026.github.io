My dad had a mitral valve replacement surgery about 10 years ago.  Since then, he has been taking warfarin to keep his blood thin, and by doing so, hopefully lessen the burden on the new valve, that it will last longer.  
With this medication, it complicates simple medical procedure or surgery.  Every procedure or surgery, he has to pad at least 3 days before and 3 days (sometimes more) after for bridging treatment.  Because I am usually hand picked to be the sucker/care taker, I unfortunately being sucked into this prolonged stay in the hospital.

Dad's last surgery was in December 2015.  He had a Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernia Repair.   We were stuck in Ipoh General Hospital for 15 days.  This time, he is being sent to Kuala Lumpur Hospital.  

Hospitals in Malaysia is extremely under equipped.  There are at least 24 patients in any given general wad.  There aren't any private rooms.  Family who wanted to accompany the patients will end up sleeping on a foldable chair or on the floor.  It simply irks me to even walk on the floor, let alone sleeping on it.  I want no part of my body touching the floor.

On top of that, there is not separate restrooms for different gender.  Because my dad stays in the male patient wads, I had to share male restrooms with the other male patients and their family, which to me is just as disgusting as the floor in the hospital.  

The hospitals are also generally understaffed.  The doctors usually just fresh off school, nurses and staffs in general hospitals are not well paid.  Everyone there are generally impatient and lack experience.  The chief doctors, each assigned about 6-10 patients, only stop by the wad twice a day, spending less than 2 minutes with each patient.  During their routine, family members were all kicked out of the wad, so they can't hear any technical medical discussion among themselves.  This is bad because sometimes (most of the times), patients don't understand doctors who speak either Malay or English.  Not every team (of doctors) have a Chinese speaking doctor/nurse who could translate.  And we all know patients themselves tend to lie, which might not be helpful to expedite treatment or recovery.  

Everyday, I could only try to get some idea of what was discussed through my dad, based on his own interpretation.  What's more fucked up is, I can't even read my dad's file.  Isn't it patient's right to own his/her own medical record?  Deep down, all these make my blood boil.

This visit home, I am stuck in a hospital with my dad, and feel like wasting my days away.  Because I don't even get face-time with the doctors, I don't get to ask all the details about my dad's condition.  Granted this time, it is only a trus biopsy (a simple outpatient procedure) he's getting, doctors pay even less attention to him.  Most days he is just  My daily contributions are to get breakfast for him (which he doesn't necessary appreciate), fetch him newspapers, and to wash his underwear. I hate the last part.  It is beneath me.  My rage primarily starts from this.  They spent tens of thousands of dollars to send me to overseas college.  And why the fuck do I end up being in fucking Malaysia cleaning my dad's underwear?  How is that the best use of my time and intelligence?  When I asked my dad if I could ask my brother to take over care-taking, he said, since you are here already, it is convenient that you just stay.  Why do I get hand picked to be the care-taker? Why my other siblings get their lives prioritized? Why I have to sacrifice my time and energy here, fetching newspapers and cleaning underwear?  Why do my parents think it is OK that I do it?  

I couldn't help but wonder if it is about money.  Back when I used to work in the US, no one from my family expected me to do such things.  I had higher buying power, and people treat me special.  At the time, every time I went home, especially before my divorce, my parents basically almost rolled out the red carpet.  Mom would cook dishes I liked.  I get to spend money to fix their problems.  What I get when I go home these days, is a stark contrast.  They just expect me to work.  Now, my sister and my brother from Taiwan, they get all the red-carpet treatments when they go home.  It makes me wonder the foundation of my family relationships and ties.  

Sibling rivalry is real.  My sister is basically the boss now.  She always cleverly have some brilliant ideas of how about "we do XXXX" but at the end I am the one end up doing the dirty shitty job while she gets credit for her idea.  This time, she said, "How about you go home and accompany dad during his stay in Kuala Lumpur Hospital.  I will split the cost for your hotel stay."  I should be the one who give this fucking speech!  I should be the one who makes USD and just spend money to solve problem instead of having to be miserably stuck there.  Instead now, I had to pay my share for my parents expenses, being physically there to do the work, and get bitched around to smuggle milk formula into Singapore on my way back for my nephew.  Seriously, what I did wrong? Where did I misstep in my life decision, to have brought myself to this lowly situation?

On the flip side of rage, I had this self-conflicted.  

Since I got out of the United States, I have not really regretted or thought much about marrying someone to get a PR/GreenCard there.  I was much of an idealist or purist to marry for love.  During last week in Malaysia, I really wished I had marry a guy for visa.  I had a strong urge to ask you if you are willing to do it.  And I would have ruined our friendship forever.  During the last week in Malaysia, I know if I ended up being in Malaysia, and ended up being in the General Hospital, I would be so angry, and have so much rage.  I would rather die.  

Having been educated about mindfulness, I start to examine myself, why I feel the way I feel.  Why I feel my rage?
- I don't feel special anymore.  When I was still working in the US, I came home with USD, I had higher buying power, and people treat me special.  
- Apparently I have sibling rivalry.  I am jealous of my sister.  And now, she has the upper hand.  She always gives idea of who should be doing what, the last idea she has was to ask me go home to accompany my dad.  Now I don't mind accompanying my dad for doctor's visit.  But I don't enjoy accompanying him for his hospital stay.  Not a single bit.  Not even that it earned me the title "Good daughter" and "Nice of you".  have been home too often.
