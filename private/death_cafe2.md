Tonight I went to Death Cafe at Charu's house.  This is the second time I joined.  The first time I joined Death Cafe was about 3 months ago.  I came home crying and extremely depressed.  I felt lonely, felt sorry for myself, and felt like a loser.  While I couldn't bring myself to kill myself, I was hopeless that I couldn't think of any reason to live.  It was a very emotional experience, that I don't feel normally.  

Given it had such "negative" impact on me, I still chose to attend Death Cafe again, because every time I go, magically all my pretense comes off layer by layer.  I always end up discovering something about myself.  

All this time, I intellectually acknowledge that death is inevitable.  And I tend to think death is probably better than living, given the rough time I am having.  Especially after last Death Cafe meetup, I had to convince myself to live.  It is an easy way out.  I made surprising discovery tonight though.  I AM ACTUALLY FEAR OF DEATH.  

It started when I shared my old folks home volunteer experience years ago.  Come to think of it, it is about 3 years now.  It was Ah Moy's Old Folks home.  I was terrified by the old people.  I somehow find the old guys scary and some creepy.  (May be my past experience of failed relationships.)  I find the old women bitter, and bitchy.  I was afraid to talk to them but I forced myself to.  I was happy when the visit was done.  Today, I recalled that extremely uneasy feeling when I was with the old folks, and for the first time I finally recognized it as fear.  I am afraid I will be like them in the future.  

Like a lightbulb lit up.  I understand why I left my dad behind in the hospital.  I understand why I was so angry and impatient there.  I was angry at the doctors and the nurses.  I was angry they didn't do a good job.  I was angry they didn't discharge dad earlier. And for the first time, I recognize that I am actually fearful of being sick and have to be admitted in the hospital.  I was worried one day I have to be like dad only receiving mediocre care, because I couldn't afford private care.  And I want to have private care because I believe I can buy better care with money.  And that all these worries, anger, frustration is really because I Actually Want to Live, despite how depressing life is.   

If I were sick in bed, dying, what would I like others, those next to me, to do to make me feel better?

Can death be beautiful?

I don't need anyone to fix my lightbulb.  I just need someone who could fix me.  

I crave for someone to ask me: "Are you ok? "

I need help healing...
